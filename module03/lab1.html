        <p>The triceratops is a 4 legged dinosaur from the late <strong>Cretaceous Period</strong> about 65-100 million years ago.
            It was a herbivore and had a large frill and 3 horns on its face and thick scales on its skin.
            It was a very large dinosaur and was one of the last dinosaurs to go extinct.
        </p>
        <p>The neck of a Triceratops had a <em>ball and socket joint</em> that allowed it to move its head up and down and side to side.
            This was useful for moving around and for defense against predators. 
            Your shoulder is a ball and socket joint, imagine if your neck was as strong as your shoulder.
            Also on its head were 3 horns, 2 above its eyes and 1 on its nose.
            The horns were made of very hard bone and were used for defense against predators and for fighting other Triceratops.
